Frameworks are designed to give us ready-made
components we can use in making webs.
Django is such a framework.
URL- Uniform Resource Locator..
How a urlresolver works..
I imagine a mail carrier with a letter.
She is walking down the street and checks each house
number against the one on the letter.
If it matches, she puts the letter there.
This is how the urlresolver works!
myenv can be activated in the terminal by typing
source myvenv/bin/activate
or
. myvenv/bin/activate
(pip install django==1.9) is used to install django
When writing regular expressions in Python it is always done with r in front of the string. This is a helpful hint for Python that the string may contain special characters that are not meant for Python itself, but for the regular expression instead.

As you can see, we're now assigning a view called post_list to ^$ URL. This regular expression will match ^ (a beginning) followed by $ (an end) - so only an empty string will match. That's correct, because in Django URL resolvers, 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' is not a part of the URL. This pattern will tell Django that views.post_list is the right place to go if someone enters your website at the 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' address.
