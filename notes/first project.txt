We start by making a "folder" that will contain all our django work.
django-admin startproject mysite . for example..
the dot tells the script to install django in the current directory.
OBJECTS:
Object-oriented-programming
modelling things and defining how they interact with each other.
object:a collection of properties and acctions.
If we want to model a cat we will create an object Cat that has some properties such as: color, age, mood (like good, bad, or sleepy ;)), and owner (that is a Person object or maybe, in case of a stray cat, this property is empty).

Then the Cat has some actions: purr, scratch, or feed (in which case, we will give the cat some CatFood, which could be a separate object with properties, like taste).

Cat
--------
color
age
mood
owner
purr()
scratch()
feed(cat_food)


CatFood
--------
taste
So basically the idea is to describe real things in code with properties (called object properties) and actions (called methods).
SO WE CAN ADD PROPERTIES of our blog
