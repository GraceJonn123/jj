Git

Git is a "version control system" used by a lot of programmers. This software can track changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. A bit like the "track changes" feature in Microsoft Word, but much more powerful.
One of the files you specified in your.gitignore file is db.sqlite3. That file is your local database, where all or your posts are stored. We don't want to add this to your repository, because your website on PythonAnywhere is going to be using a different database. That database could be SQLite, like your development machine, but usually, you will use one called MySQL which can deal with a lot more site visitors than SQLite. Either way, by ignoring your SQLite database for the GitHub copy, it means that all of the posts you created so far are going to stay and only be available locally, but you're gonna have to add them again on production. You should think of your local database as a good playground where you can test different things and not be afraid that you're going to delete your real posts from your blog.
