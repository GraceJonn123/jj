CREATING AN APP:


class Post(models.Model): - this line defines our model (it is an object).

class is a special keyword that indicates that we are defining an object.
Post is the name of our model. We can give it a different name (but we must avoid special characters and whitespaces). Always start a class name with an uppercase letter.
models.Model means that the Post is a Django Model, so Django knows that it should be saved in the database.
KEYWORDS:

models.CharField - this is how you define text with a limited number of characters.
models.TextField - this is for long text without a limit. Sounds ideal for blog post content, right?
models.DateTimeField - this is a date and time.
models.ForeignKey - this is a link to another model.
